# Mutable Instruments Anushri alternate case design

This is my alternate case design for the Mutable Instruments Anushri monosynth which has since been discontinued by Mutable Instruments but is available as an open-source project:
https://github.com/pichenettes/anushri

This particular case design is a modified version of another alternate case design created by a user who goes by the name of 'soup' on the Mutable Instruments forums.

Design includes extra labels under some of the multi-function knobs so there is no confusion about what parameters are being modified at any given time. The design also includes a MIDI CC (control change) reference printed on the bottom panel as well as a series of glyphs and other dingbats which were designed by papernoise, example can be found:

Here's what it looks like cut into some fluro-orange acrylic:
